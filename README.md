# LeetCode

1. 1-top-k-freq-els

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

2. 2-pow(x,n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n.

3. 3-longest-substr

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 3 solutions produced each with O(N^3), O(2N) AND O(N)

4. 4-kth-largest-el

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element. Incomplete.

5. 5-check-straight-line

You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

6. 6-two-sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. Complete: solution with O(n^2). Incomplete: solution with O(nlogn).

7. 7-can-make-ap

Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false.

8. 8-valid-parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

9. 9-longest-common-prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

10. 10-min-flips

Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
